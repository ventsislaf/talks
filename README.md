## from tictactoe to gobblet

### remark

* original tictactoe repo is [here](https://github.com/ventsislaf/talks)
  
### what I have done

- [x] using Registry in Elixir 1.4 instead of [gproc](https://github.com/uwiger/gproc).
- [x] error message from original repo: [link](https://github.com/ventsislaf/talks/issues/1).
- [x] bug from original repo: when one game is finished, no player clicks the new game button, then a player logs out and another player joins the previous game, the game is stuck.

### what I aim at: [repo](https://github.com/cjen07/gobblet)
- [x] replace js by elm 
- [x] extend tictictoe to [gobblet](https://github.com/cjen07/gobblet-gobblers)
